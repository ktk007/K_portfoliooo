            <p>Bhaktapur (Nepali and Sanskrit: भक्तपुर, pronounced [ˈbʱʌkt̪ʌpur] (listen); lit. "City of Devotees"),
                known locally as Khwopa[3] and historically called Bhatgaon, is a
                city in the east corner of the Kathmandu Valley in Nepal located about 13 kilometres (8.1 mi) from the
                capital city, Kathmandu.[3][5] Bhaktapur is the smallest city of Nepal as well the most densely
                populated.[3][6] Along with Kathmandu and Lalitpur, Bhaktapur is one of the three main cities of the
                Kathmandu Valley and is a major Newar settlement of the country. The city is also known for its Newar
                tradition, cuisine and artisans.[7] Bhaktapur suffered heavy damage in the April 2015 earthquake.

                As part of the Kathmandu Valley, it shares its history, culture and language with the other cities of
                the valley. Although chronicles like the Gopal Raj Vamshavali put the foundation of Bhaktapur in the
                12th century, it has been the site of numerous settlements since at least the Licchavi dynasty.[8]
                Bhaktapur served as the capital of Nepal during the first half of Malla dynasty from the 12th century to
                1482 when Nepal split into three independent kingdoms.[3][9] The Malla dynasty is considered a golden
                period for Bhaktapur and even after its division in 1428, Bhaktapur managed to stay as a wealthy and a
                powerful Newar kingdom, mostly due to its position in the ancient India-Tibet trade route.[8] In 1769,
                Bhaktapur was attacked and annexed into the expanding Gorkha Kingdom (which later became the Kingdom of
                Nepal).[10] After its annexation, Bhaktapur remained largely isolated from other parts of Nepal which
                led to stagnation in the development of its economy and arts and to allowed it to remain as a
                homogeneous Newar city.[11] Due to being isolated and overlooked by the central government in Kathmandu,
                its infrastructure and economy deteriorated and the 1934 earthquake further exacerbated the
                situation.[12] Bhaktapur's economy and infrastructure would only improve from the 1980s, largely due to
                tourism and aid provided by West Germany as part of the Bhaktapur Development Project.[12]

                Compared to other Newar settlements, Bhaktapur is predominantly Hindu and speaks a distinct dialect of
                Nepal Bhasa.[11][2] Bhaktapur is one of the most visited tourist destination of Nepal with the city
                attracting 301,012 tourists in 2014.[13] The Nyatapola, a five roofed pagoda completed in 1702 is the
                most famous structure of Bhaktapur and along with the former royal palace, it forms the tourism center
                of Bhaktapur. The city is also famous for its numerous festivals and carnivals like the spring festival
                of Biskā jātrā and the carnival of Sāpāru (or Gai jatra) both of which are significant part of the local
                culture and contribute well to tourism.[14] Bhaktapur is also called the "Capital of Music and Dance"
                (Nepali: नाचगानको राजधानी) in Nepal due to presence of over 200 types of traditional dances, most of
                which are masked dances and expect for a few, are a part of the annual carnival of Sāpāru (or Gai
                jatra).[15] It is also famous for its cuisine with the jūjū dhau, a type of yogurt made from buffalo
                milk being the most popular. Bhaktapur's potters and handicraft industries are also known
                nationwide.[16][17] Due to its well preserved medieval nature, UNESCO inscribed Bhaktapur as a World
                Heritage Site since 1979.[16][13]</p>
