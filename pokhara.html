            <p>Pokhara (Nepali: पोखरा [ˈpokʰʌɾa]) is a metropolitan city in central Nepal, which serves as the capital
                of Gandaki Province.[4] It is the second most populous city of Nepal after Kathmandu, with 599,504
                inhabitants living in 120,594 households in 2021.[3] It is the country's largest metropolitan city in
                terms of area. The city also serves as the headquarters of Kaski District.[5] Pokhara is located 200
                kilometres (120 miles) west of the capital, Kathmandu. The city is on the shore of Phewa Lake, and sits
                at an elevation of approximately 822m.[6] The Annapurna Range, with three out of the ten highest peaks
                in the world—Dhaulagiri, Annapurna I and Manaslu—is within 15–35 mi (24–56 km) of the valley.[7][8] The
                current mayor of Pokhara is Dhana Raj Acharya from CPN (Unified Socialist).[9][10]

                Pokhara is considered the tourism capital of Nepal,[11] being a base for trekkers undertaking the
                Annapurna Circuit through the Annapurna Conservation Area region[12] of the Annapurna ranges in the
                Himalayas. The city is also home to many of the elite Gurkha soldiers, soldiers native to South Asia of
                Nepalese nationality recruited for the British Army, Nepalese Army, Indian Army, Gurkha Contingent
                Singapore, Gurkha Reserve Unit Brunei, UN peacekeeping forces and in war zones around the world.[13]By
                radiocarbon dating and investigating the alluvial deposits of Pokhara Valley, researchers have found
                that there were at least three large medieval earthquakes in 1000, 1255, and 1344 AD. Up to 9 cubic
                kilometres of conglomerates, massive mud and silt show indications of one or several megafloods that
                emanated from the Sabche Cirque in the Annapurna range.[14]

                Pokhara lies on an important old trading route between China and India. In the 17th century, it was part
                of the Kingdom of Kaski which was one of the Chaubisi rajya (24 Kingdoms of Nepal, चौबिसे राज्य) ruled
                by a branch of the Shah dynasty. Many of the hills around Pokhara still have medieval ruins from this
                time. In 1786, Prithvi Narayan Shah added Pokhara into his kingdom. It had by then become an important
                trading place on the routes from Kathmandu to Jumla and from India to Tibet.[15]</p>
