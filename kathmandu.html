            <p>Kathmandu,[a] officially Kathmandu Metropolitan City,[b] is the capital and most populous city of Nepal
                with 845,767 inhabitants living in 105,649 households as of the 2021 Nepal census[2] and 2.9 million
                people in its urban agglomeration. It is located in the Kathmandu Valley, a large valley in the high
                plateaus in central Nepal, at an altitude of 1,400 metres (4,600 feet).

                The city is one of the oldest continuously inhabited places in the world, founded in the 2nd century AD.
                The valley was historically called the "Nepal Mandala" and has been the home of the Newar people, a
                cosmopolitan urban civilization in the Himalayan foothills. The city was the royal capital of the
                Kingdom of Nepal and hosts palaces, mansions and gardens built by the Nepali aristocracy. It has been
                home to the headquarters of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) since 1985 AD.
                Today, it is the seat of government of the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal, established in 2008 AD,
                and is part of Bagmati Province.

                Kathmandu is and has been for many years the centre of Nepal's history, art, culture, and economy. It
                has a multi-ethnic population within a Hindu and Buddhist majority. Religious and cultural festivities
                form a major part of the lives of people residing in Kathmandu. Tourism is an important part of the
                economy in the city. In 2013, Kathmandu was ranked third among the top ten upcoming travel destinations
                in the world by TripAdvisor, and ranked first in Asia. The city is considered the gateway to the Nepal
                Himalayas and is home to several World Heritage Sites: the Durbar Square, Swayambhu Mahachaitya, Bouddha
                and Pashupatinath. Kathmandu valley is growing at 4 per cent per year according to the World Bank in
                2010 AD, making it one of the fastest-growing metropolitan areas in South Asia, and the first region in
                Nepal to face the unprecedented challenges of rapid urbanization and modernization at a metropolitan
                scale.[4] It is the largest metropolitan area located in the Himalayas.</p>
