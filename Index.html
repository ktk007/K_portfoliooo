            <p>Tourism is the largest industry in Nepal and its largest source of foreign exchange and revenue.
                Possessing
                eight of the ten highest mountains in the world, Nepal is a hot spot destination for mountaineers, rock
                climbers and people seeking adventure. The Hindu and Buddhist heritage of Nepal and its cool weather are
                also strong attractions.According to Nepal's Ministry of Tourism, major tourist activities include
                wilderness and adventure activities such as mountain biking, bungee jumping, rock climbing and mountain
                climbing, trekking, hiking, bird watching, flights, paragliding and hot air ballooning over the
